# Hey! What's up?

My name is СтранныйРусский (technically I'm Luke Chemeriov, but we won't worry about that yet).

<i>(I know this says I use HTML, CSS and such, but I don't. That's just because of the fakescanners section of my <a href="https://github.com/LukeChemeriov/Malware/tree/main/Fake%20Scanners">malware</a> repository.)</i>







I am a Russian C++ programmer who has nothing else to do except to have fun with sometimes useless programs with some malware slotted in, which, of course, is used responsibly. I'm not stupid...

Please enjoy what I have here. For malware, the passwords will be `chemeriov`. 

Thank you for reading this. Go watch some anime (like death note).
