# Hey! What's up?

My name is СтранныйРусский (technically I'm Luke Chemeriov, but we won't worry about that yet).

I am a Russian C++ programmer who has nothing else to do except to have fun with sometimes useless programs with some malware slotted in, which, of course, is used responsibly. I'm not stupid...

Please enjoy what I have here. For malware, the passwords will be `chemeriov`. (Actually, I haven't uploaded anything yet)

Thank you for reading this. Go watch some anime.
