Привет!
Hello! :)
My name is СтранныйРусский (technically it's 
Luke Chemeriov, but we won't worry about that for now)

I use C++ to make fun, useless programs with some malware - that is used responsibly of course.

Please enjoy stuff, for malware the repository passwords
will be `chemeriov`. (Actually, I haven't uploaded anything yet)

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and yes, if you
were wondering, I am Russian.
